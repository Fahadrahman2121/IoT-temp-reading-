# IoT-temp-reading-
Multiple IoT devices sent temp data from remote location to a central processing unit 
We have a list if data collected by five IoT devices (IoT1 - IoT5) There is variation in all devices data;
We need to conclude which device data is accurate 
We applied Mean, Weightage, and Consensus apporach
The proposed apporach is ABQ (Asymmetric Byzentine Quorums)
The best results provided ABQ technique
Best results = IoT results, bcz IoT1 results are assumed are most accurate
Other IoT out put is derived from IoT1.
